# Meme-Detector-Neural-Network
A Convolutional Neural Network that detects wich images are memes and wich aren't.

# Instructions
Just put all your data(Meme and non meme images) on to a folder and divide them in subfolders with name 0(for memes) and 1(for non memes).
With this, the code will search into the folder and automatically load and label all the images for the training and testing.
You can change your folder direction on the "folder" variable on the Create_Dataset.py file

Run the Create_Dataset.py file to create a .h5 file containing all the dataset and then run the Meme_Model.py with the dataset created.
Every time you add data you must run the Create Dataset.py file.
